In the document ("Admissions Subsequent Enrollment for Prospective Students/Former Applicants"), National Student Clearinghouse
maintains that records "maintained by an institution about an individual who has submitted a request for information (prospect) or 
applied for admission but has not been admitted and enrolled are not considered 'education records' under FERPA." Under this definition,
institutions may request and share unblocked directory information on students who fit these criteria.
